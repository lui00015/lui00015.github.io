            Hello, my name is <em>Ray Lui</em>. I am currently studying at Algonquin College. I have loved art since I was a child and loved visiting museums. He is full of curiosity about new things and likes to communicate with different people.

            I love sports, especially water sports and surfing. I believe learning is a continuous process and I strive to <em>improve</em> every day.
